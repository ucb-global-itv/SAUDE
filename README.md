# GLOBAL ITV HEALTHCARE APP

Latest version: run "main_v1_2.ncl"

If you don't have a TV stream (such as in the Linux set-top box emulator), 
   run "main_v1_2_with_background_image.ncl", which has a
   background image ONLY TO SIMULATE THE TV STREAM.

If you only need the files for the latest version (that is, if you don't
   need all the other files used in the development of this app),
   use the compressed file "main_v1_2.zip". 

If you only need the files for the latest version WITH THE BACKGROUND IMAGE,
   use the compressed file "main_v1_2_with_background_image.zip".
